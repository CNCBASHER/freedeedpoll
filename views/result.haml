    %h3 Printing tips
    %ul
      %li Print onto A4 paper.
      %li Use a nice, heavy paper, such as parchment paper, to give it a professional finish.
      %li
        Make two or three original copies, by printing and signing it several times.
        Some organisations will insist on seeing an original, not a photocopy, so it's faster
        to send off several originals at the same time.

    %hr

    %h3 So that's it?
    %p
      Yes!
      %em As soon as you sign that document, you've changed your name.
      Congratulations!
    %p
      You still need to tell all of the people you do business with that you've changed
      your name. Scroll down for tips, and template letters.

            easier to prove your identity to other organisations.

            If you have a driving license - including a provisional one - you should update it early
            on, because this will provide you with government-issued, photographic identificiation
            under your new name, which will make it easier to prove your identity to other organisations.

            So long as you have both parts of your license, there is no charge for this service.
            Note that you do not need to send a new photo.

            Fill in a form D1 (D2 if you drive a bus or lorry). You can get this from the Post Office,

            Advising your bank of your new name early on is important, or else you will be unable to
            accept cheques in your new name, and your photographic ID will not match the details that
            your bank has on file for you (which could make proving your identity difficult if you
            lose your bank card!). It's especially important that you advise any organisation from
            which you've taken our a loan, to ensure that they don't think that you're trying to
            fraudulently escape from your debt.

            sent to your correct name. There's usually no rush to ensure that the electoral roll is
