  %p
    %strong How should I write my name?
  %p
    Write your full name, including any middle names, completely.

  %p
    %strong Should I include my title (e.g. Mr., Ms.)?
  %p
    No. You can include a title if you want, so long as it is a title that you would
    normally be allowed to use. However, we'd recommend that you do not.

  %p
    %strong Can I make a Deed Poll for somebody else?
  %p
    Yes! Deeds Poll make great gifts, but remember that it's up to the other person
    to read and sign it - you can't do that bit for them.

  %p
    %strong Are there any restrictions on the name I choose?
  %p
    Legally-speaking, you may choose any name you like. However, you should:

  %ul
    %li Have at least two names (a first name and a surname), though you may have more.
    %li Not change your name to imply a title that you do not have (e.g. changing your first name to Doctor).
    %li Spell your name using only characters in the Latin alphabet.
    %li Ensure that your name is pronouncable.

  %p
    For more information on choosing your name, see:
    %a{:href => '#'} choosing a name

  %p
    %strong What will you do with this information?
  %p
    Your name will only be used to generate your Deed Poll. We will not keep your
    personal information for any longer than is necessary to generate your document.

  %p
    %strong Why are you asking this?
  %p
    If you're changing your first name, the wording of your Deed Poll needs to be slightly different. If your
    new first name is different from your old first name - even if you're just shortening it - you must check
    the checkbox. If your first name is the same, don't check it.

  %p
    %strong Who can be a witness?
  %p
    Your witness should be somebody who knows you personally, but is not closely related to you. A friend
    or co-worker is fine. Your spouse, sibling, parents or children are not. Your witness must be at least
    18 years old.

  %p
    %strong Do I have to have two witnesses?
  %p
    No, but you should. If you want to make a Deed Poll signed by only one witness, just leave the boxes blank.
    But having a second witness helps to protect you in case the legitimacy of your Deed Poll is challenged.

  %p
    %strong This is the last question!
  %p
    You're almost there. When you click the "Generate" button, your Deed Poll will be generated, and you'll be able
    to print it off and sign it.
